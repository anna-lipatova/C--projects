# NPRG038 Assignments Repository

Do not forget to properly name your directories and files so that teachers can easily find them. Your solution must be in correct directory for the specific home assignment + in correct projects and files according to the assignment specification.

After you complete an assignment, do not forget to mark it as completed in SIS. Check the column with home assignment number and name and "SUBMIT" suffix - e.g. for home assignment 1 check "DU1 - Physics SUBMIT".

Incorrecly named solutions or solutions without checked relevant "SUBMIT" in SIS will NOT be graded!
